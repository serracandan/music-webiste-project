# Scorpions Band Website

This is a simple website project designed for my HTML course. It is based on the German rock band Scorpions. The project includes 13 different pages such as Home, About, Albums, Tour Dates and Contact. It was built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on responsive layout and visual aesthetics. 

ðŸ“Œ *Note: This is a non-functional visual prototype â€” buttons and interactive elements are not fully implemented.*

# Features 

- Custom layout and styling with HTML & CSS
- Responsive design basics (viewport aware)
- Multiple themed pages reflecting Scorpions' official site design
- Embedded video and image media

# Disclaimer 

This is a **student project**, created for educational purposes only. Some elements (like buttons, forms, etc.) are **not interactive** and are presented as static mockups.
