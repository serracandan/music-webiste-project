    Like many youngsters born in post-war Germany, Klaus Meine and Rudolf Schenker were influenced
    by the music and other life-enhancing delights imported into their homeland by American GI’s – Elvis Presley, chewing gum, blue jeans and leather
    jackets, but most of all rock ‘n’ roll. From an early age, both of them had an irresistible urge to grab a guitar and step into the limelight.
    In the early 1960s the Beatles sparked off the beat revolution. By the mid-1960s Klaus Meine and Rudolf Schenker, both of whom were blessed with
    understanding parents, had also taken to the stage with their beat groups. In 1965 Rudolf Schenker started up the SCORPIONS in Hanover. Rudolf’s
    younger brother Michael Schenker was, like Matthias Jabs, smitten by beat music and the burgeoning rock culture. Guitarist and songwriter Rudolf
    Schenker’s earliest influences were the raw riffs of bands like The Yardbirds, Pretty Things and Spooky Tooth, who in those days were regarded as
    the real hard rockers. At New Year 1970, the younger Schenker brother Michael, who despite his youth had already established himself as an outstanding
    guitarist, left the Hanover-based group Copernicus, along with singer and composer Klaus Meine, to join Rudolf Schenker’s SCORPIONS. Rudolf Schenker
    and Klaus Meine teamed up to form the accomplished Schenker/Meine songwriting duo, so laying the foundations for a spectacular success story.

    In 1972, the SCORPIONS released their remarkable debut album, Lonesome Crow, produced by Conny Plank in Hamburg. The vocal and instrumental ingredients
    which over the years were to develop into the typical, unmistakable SCORPIONS sound, were already recognisable: uncompromising, guitar-orientated hard
    rock, on the lines of what Jimmy Hendrix, Cream and Led Zeppelin generated in the mid-1960s. The distinctive SCORPIONS style came from the combination
    of two electric guitars, a fusion of fabulously forceful power riffs with dazzlingly exuberant guitar solos. Added to which was the instantly recognisable
    voice of singer and front man Klaus Meine with his highly expressive and polished delivery. In one respect, the SCORPIONS were unique on the German rock
    scene of the period. Because, right from the start, the band was aiming for the very top of the international hard rock business, Klaus Meine wrote all
    his lyrics in English. In the creative partnership of Rudolf Schenker and Klaus Meine Germany had finally found its answer to the famous beat and rock
    composing teams of the English-speaking world. The first album Lonesome Crow set the band on the path to international success. The SCORPIONS toured as
    support band with Rory Gallagher, Uriah Heep and UFO. Throughout their history Rudolf Schenker has been the unshakeable driving force behind the
    SCORPIONS. He adopted his father’s philosophy of life – nothing is impossible as long as you believe in it. Right from the foundation of the SCORPIONS,
    he had only one declared ambition: "one day the SCORPIONS will be one of the best heavy rock bands in the world!" It was an idea to which all the band
    members were committed. The SCORPIONS were constantly on the lookout for fresh challenges. Every change in the line-up was seen as an opportunity to move
    closer still to success and the achievement of absolute professionalism.

    Since 1974, the SCORPIONS had In 1979, now professionally managed and boosted by the success of Lovedrive, the SCORPIONS with their definitive line-up
    – Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs – embarked on their first major tour of USA rock arenas as opening act with Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and
    AC/DC. In Chicago, the SCORPIONS swapped the headliner billing with Ted Nugent, since the SCORPIONS had more fans in the city. On this first American
    tour, the SCORPIONS quickly learned the rules of the game in the international rock business.

    <span style="font-family: Impact, serif;font-size:60px;color: white">1985</span><br><br>
    The SCORPIONS’ most memorable appearances as headliners were at the 1983 US FESTIVAL in California’s San Bernadino Valley in front of an audience
    of 325,000 and at the first Rock in Rio in 1985 where they were cheered by 350,000 enthusiastic South American SCORPIONS fans. The 1985 double album
    WORLD WIDE LIVE, a counterpart to the 1978 TOKYO TAPES, impressively documented the band’s more recent international triumphs. In 1986, the SCORPIONS
    topped the bill at the legendary MONSTERS OF ROCK Festival and played in the Hungarian capital Budapest, their first-ever appearance in an Eastern Block
    country. By now the SCORPIONS were a household name, with hard rock hits like "Rock You Like a Hurricane", "No One Like You", "Blackout", "Big City
    Nights", "Dynamite", "Bad Boys Running Wild", "Coast to Coast" and "The Zoo" featuring in the charts around the world. In the 1980s, the SCORPIONS
    created a kind of modern hard rock that is just as popular today. Their authentic power rock ballads, such as "Still Loving You", "Holiday" and later
    "Wind of Change", "Send Me an Angel", "When You Came Into My Life" and "You and I", along with acoustic based songs such as "Always Somewhere" and "When
    the Smoke is Going Down" have managed to win over even the most unyielding haters of hard rock.

    <span style="font-family: Impact, serif;font-size:60px;color: white">1996</span><br><br>
    In 1995 the SCORPIONS engaged former AC/DC manager Stewart Young, and it fell to him to call James Kottak on the phone and hire him as
    drummer for the upcoming 1996/97 Pure Instinct Live Tour. James Kottak became the first American to play in the German rock band. With
    the two new members, bass player Ralph Rieckermann and drummer James Kottak, the SCORPIONS had introduced a new generation of musicians
    into the group. On the Pure Instinct world tour, the SCORPIONS proved that they were still among the global players on the international
    rock scene. Not only did they play in Europe, the USA and South America. In countries like Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, they
    continued to notch up well above average record sales and collect gold and platinum discs. In November 1996, the SCORPIONS were the first
    international hard rock band to play to fans in Beirut after the end of the civil war in Lebanon. On the 1999 recording of Eye to Eye,
    produced by Peter Wolf, James Kottak worked in the studio with the SCORPIONS for the first time. The cover of Eye to Eye marked a change
    of image for the SCORPIONS. Only the founder members of the band, Rudolf Schenker, Klaus Meine and Matthias Jabs feature on the front cover.
    The album itself is a statement of the SCORPIONS’ awesome talents as songwriters and instrumentalists. Songs like Mysterious, Mind Like a Tree,
    Eye to Eye, Yellow Butterfly and A Moment in a Million Years show the band at the pinnacle of their creativity. With Du Bist So Schmutzig (You’re
    So Dirty), the SCORPIONS are heard for the first time singing a German lyric. As part of their 1999 Eye to Eye world tour, at the invitation of
    Michael Jackson, they played at the Michael Jackson and Friends benefit concert in Munich. True to their motto "Don’t stop at the top" the SCORPIONS
    are starting the new millennium with a new musical challenge: a crossover project with the internationally renowned classical orchestra, the Berlin
    Philharmonic, once conducted by the great Herbert von Karajan. - See more at:<a style="color:white;" href="http://www.scorpions.band/english/history.asp#sthash.1TBC6Kf6.dpuf" alt="see more">

    With their uncompromising rock album UNBREAKABLE the SCORPIONS have unequivocally sounded their return in 2004 to the worldwide hard ’n’ heavy music
    rena. UNBREAKABLE is a concept album in a very special sense. It symbolises the indestructibility of the basic musical coordinates of the SCORPIONS.
    The unique power triad of outstanding musical figures: singer-songwriter Klaus Meine, guitarist and composer Rudolf Schenker and lead guitarist and
    composer Matthias Jabs. UNBREAKABLE, the twentieth SCORPIONS album, is the quintessence of thirty-five years of SCORPIONS history. And at the same time
    it marks the re-commitment of Germany’s internationally most successful hard rock export to their essential strengths. “First and foremost we are a rock
    band,” says Klaus Meine, leaving no room for doubt. “Our fans expect to really feel the lethal sting of the SCORPIONS. So with UNBREAKABLE we’ve recorded
    a typical SCORPIONS album.” Seconded by Rudolf Schenker: “After side projects like Moment Of Glory and Acoustica we owed our fans a kick-ass, bad-to-the
    -bone rock CD.” Rudolf Schenker sees UNBREAKABLE as building a bridge between the SCORPIONS and their fans. “It’s an album that brings the old and the
    new generation of SCORPIONS fans together.<br><br> Matthias Jabs sums it up: “With the new album we’ve returned to what the SCORPIONS are really all about.
    Hand-made rock music. Pick up the instruments, plug them in, play,” is how he describes the highly successful three months spent working in the studio
    with producer Erwin Musper. “The band together in one room for the basic tracks - back to the roots but in the contemporary rock sound of 2004. And at
    the same time we’ve reshaped our live set with the new songs.” Erwin Musper, who as producer and sound engineer knows the SCORPIONS better than anyone
    else, goes even further: “The SCORPIONS have set a new standard with UNBREAKABLE. It’s the best material the SCORPIONS have written in the last five
    years. Any rock band setting out to record a new album, should have UNBREAKABLE as a reference in their sound library.” Erwin Musper knows what he’s
    talking about. Born in The Netherlands, he’s been working with the SCORPIONS as producer and engineer since 1988. In addition, he has worked in the
    USA for many years as producer for bands such as Metallica, Iron Maiden, Van Halen, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. SCORPIONS drummer/composer, James Kottak,
    is up front about it: “UNBREAKABLE is the best record ever from Germany’s No. 1 rock machine.” With UNBREAKABLE 2004 Klaus Meine, Rudolf Schenker and
    Matthias Jabs are going onto the musical offensive with a typical SCORPIONS coup: Pawel Maciwoda is the new bass player of Germany’s globally most
    successful rock act. This new band member is another signal that there’s no going back for the SCORPIONS.<br><br> Together with drummer James Kottak, this
    hard rock bass player, steeled in the New York professional scene, represents a pressure build-up in the SCORPIONS’ now outstanding rhythm’n’groove
    section. UNBREAKABLE symbolises the musical and personal identity that has characterised the SCORPIONS for over thirty-five years and accounted for
    their lasting worldwide success. All this has ensured that the SCORPIONS are the only German band to have unswervingly pursued an international career
    for over thirty-five years. “We’ve often been through hell, to experience heaven. We’ve always had faith in ourselves and have never accepted
    limitations for ourselves,” is how Rudolf Schenker sums it up. “Doing a world tour and seeing how people respond to the music and are carried
    away by it,” is for Rudolf Schenker simply “the best there is.” An “adventure” that he “wouldn’t miss for the world.” For SCORPIONS vocalist Klaus
    Meine it’s “a fascinating experience, again and again, to contribute towards a peaceful world through the global language of music. To show that music
    is a language that crosses frontiers and overcomes differences.” The outstanding date in this respect was the concert the SCORPIONS – from Germany –
    gave in 2002 in Volgograd. For these musicians, born in post-war Germany between 1948 and 1955, it was a deeply felt contribution towards atonement.
    What’s important for Matthias Jabs is to make “music that’s enduring” and that embodies the identity of the SCORPIONS. Over time and up there in front
    of the fans. Music that satisfies the band’s own musical needs and those of their audiences. Music, above all, that stands the test of a live concert –
    in the full exposure of the spotlights, “where you can’t hide anything.” In 2004 Klaus Meine gives this summary of the impressive history of the
    SCORPIONS: “There’ll never be any substitute for live concerts with real music and real feelings.” It’s a statement from the heart that also looks
    forward into the future. And UNBREAKABLE is the musical statement of now from Germany’s only global band.

    SCORPIONS RETURN TO FOREVER celebrating 50 years!<br><br>
    Celebrating a half-century of rock with the release of their 19th studio album, RETURN TO FOREVER (Sony Music/Legacy Recordings), globally on 20
    February 2015 (North America release on 11 September 2015) with the first single and video "We Build This House".<br><br>
    On 11 December 2014 the band announced their global 50th anniversary tour which kicked off in China on 1st May and runs through spring 2016.<br><br>
    On 25 February the Scorpion announce a 16 date North American tour kicking off in Boston on 10 September.<br><br>
    So the band once again met up with their two favorite Swedes to realize a project, which initially had been
    intended to be rather plain. Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen had already produced “Sting In The
    Tail”, and re-arranged the whole material for “MTV Unplugged” together with Matthias Jabs.
    “Actually, we only wanted to finally record some song ideas for the fans, which we had worked on in the
    past but never put on an album, and then release them without much fanfare”, Matthias Jabs remembers.
    “There had been quite a few over the years, ideas that were really good, but in the end didn’t make the cut
    back then due to the limited space on vinyl and later on CD. We quickly had eight songs, which partly had
    to be finalized first and were then recorded from scratch. During the work, increasingly new song ideas
    were added from our end, as well as from the two Swedes. We had so much fun working and suddenly we
    found ourselves in the middle of the songwriting process once again. And in the end, it turned out to be a
    brand-new Scorpions album after all.”<br><br>
    The fact that the fiftieth band anniversary was coming up as well, hit Rudolf rather accidentally: “Not long
    ago I found an old cash account book of my mom’s, in which she meticulously recorded the earnings and
    expenses of my band Scorpions fifty years ago. My parents had lent me the money for the first equipment
    back then, and it had to paid off in installments from the earnings. 50 years are a long time. Apart from us,
    at most the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys or The Who managed to do that. In that sense, the timing for
    the new album is perfect, we’re celebrating half a decade of Scorpions with the record and the upcoming
    tour.”
