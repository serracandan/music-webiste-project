      Dear fans and friends,
      As you may have heard before, I had a bad accident at the vacation house I was renting.
      I fell down the stairs 16 steps and broke my left pinky toe twice and also broke my left heel.
      I had both hand and foot surgery performed in Hamburg by the best specialists I could find.
      Now is the time to recover and begin physical rehabilitation for a speedy recovery.
      I will try everything to be able to play guitar on stage again as soon as possible.
      I am sorry to say that the demonstrations in September will not take place, but I am very optimistic that we will see each other again very soon.<br>
      Rock n Roll forever,<br>
      Yours Matthias</td>

      The SCORPIONS are forced to cancel all upcoming German tour dates in September 2024 due to an injury sustained
      by Matthias Jabs. Matthias Jabs’ injury requires surgery and subsequent rehabilitation. The cancellation hits the band hard,
      as they were in the final stretch of their “Love At First Sting” world tour. They deeply regret this decision and apologize
      to the more than 40,000 fans who have already purchased tickets, as well as to the event organizers.<br>
      You can find the band’s full statement here:<br>
      "We deeply regret, especially Matthias Jabs, that due to the accident of our friend and Scorpions lead guitarist, the five
      concerts on our German tour cannot take place in September as planned, and we will work closely with the tour organizer to
      announce new information as soon as possible. We kindly ask for your understanding from all our fans, all the Rock Believers
      in Germany who were looking forward to the shows with us."<br>
      Klaus, Rudolf, Mikkey und Pawel.<br>
      Ticket holders will receive further information directly from their point of purchase shortly.</td>

      Diamond in the 80s to his iconic 25-year tenure with Motörhead. Now with Scorpions, Mikkey’s drumming continues to set the
      standard for generations to come. Cheers to Mikkey Dee, a true legend of the genre and Modern Drummer’s March cover.</td>
